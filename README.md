** starting from -index.html **

This is a ready-to-use starter kit for building a 6-page static website in 1 day.

Built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JS
Clean UI with reusable components (header, footer, navbar).
Ready pages: Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact
New pages can be generated quickly from a template
Responsive by default
Common sections (header, footer, CSS/JS) automatically apply to all pages.

How it work-

Open any `.html` file in your browser.
To create a new page:
Copy an existing page (e.g., `about.html`).
Change the `<title>` and `<main>` content only.
Header, navbar, and footer load automatically.

- `/components-resuable` → shared header, navbar, footer
- `/assets/js/main.js` → loads components

All the page is similar to index.html we can make multiple page just simply copy the one page 

Easy way to add pages (only change content, no need to redesign).
